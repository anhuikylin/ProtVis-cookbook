## Data Loading

Based on the selected data source from the previous step, the interface will automatically redirect to the corresponding page.\
If the analysis is interrupted, you can resume it at any time by clicking the **Load Data** button (after completing the first step of setting the working directory).

Once the data is successfully loaded, the right panel will display both the **sample information** and the **expression matrix**.

## Data Preprocessing

After loading, the protein data undergoes preprocessing by filtering out unreliable peptides.

### Available Filtering Methods

There are three filtering strategies available. You may select one or combine them as needed:

1.  **Remove peptides identified only by site**\
    Excludes peptides identified solely by site-specific modifications, which may lack confident sequence-level evidence.

2.  **Remove potential contaminant peptides**\
    Filters out peptides that are likely derived from common contaminants (e.g., keratin, trypsin).

3.  **Remove reverse peptides**\
    Removes reverse (decoy) peptides used for estimating the false discovery rate (FDR) during database searching.

### Execution and Reporting

-   Click the **REMOVE** button to apply the selected filters.\
-   Click the **REPORT** button to view the preprocessing summary for each selected filtering method.
