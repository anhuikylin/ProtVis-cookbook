## Introduction

The **Toolkits** module in **ProtVis** offers a suite of utility tools for protein-level data extraction, structural annotation, and external linking. These tools assist users in post-analysis exploration, helping researchers dig deeper into protein function, structure, and expression.

## ðŸ§ª Protein Extract

**Purpose**:  
Extract protein sequences based on a list of gene identifiers.

**Features**:
- Input gene IDs (e.g., from DEG, GO/KEGG results, or manual selection).
- Retrieve corresponding **protein sequences** from the internal annotation database.

**Use Case**:
Ideal for preparing FASTA files for downstream structure prediction, motif analysis, or epitope mapping.

## ðŸ”— Protein Links

**Purpose**:  
Generate dynamic links from protein identifiers or sequences to external annotation and structure tools.

**Supported Destinations**:

- **UniProt**: protein function, domain, GO annotations  
- **InterProScan**: domain and motif annotation  
- **Swiss-Model**: 3D structure modeling  

**Input Type**:
- Gene ID
- Protein sequence (FASTA format)

**Use Case**:
For functional and structural exploration via external resources without leaving the app interface.

## ðŸ§¬ Protein Structure

**Purpose**:  
Visualize structural features of proteins such as:
- Helices, sheets, turns (secondary structure)
- Domains
- Sites of modification or interaction

**Data Sources**:
- **UniProt annotation**
- Predicted models from **Swiss-Model** or **AlphaFold**

**Use Case**:
Understand the spatial arrangement of proteins and pinpoint regions of interest (e.g., phosphorylation sites, mutations, etc.).

## ðŸ“Š Boxplot

**Purpose**:  
Visualize protein abundance or intensity across conditions or groups.

**Features**:
- Select one or multiple proteins
- Customize colors, themes, labels
- Display statistical annotations (t-test, ANOVA p-values)

**Use Case**:
Used in publication figures or presentations to highlight biologically important proteins.
