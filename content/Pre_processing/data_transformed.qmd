In proteomics, quantitative data often spans several orders of magnitude, exhibiting a right-skewed distribution and heteroscedasticityâ€”where variance increases with mean intensity. Applying a logarithmic transformation (commonly log10 or log2) compresses high values, expands low values, and stabilizes variance, making the data more normally distributed. This improves the reliability of statistical analyses such as *t*-tests and linear models. Additionally, log transformation prevents high-abundance proteins from dominating visualizations, enhancing comparability across proteins of different abundance levels. It is often used in conjunction with normalization to correct for batch effects and sample loading variability.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1**: Load the input data.

**Step 2**: Choose a data transformation method. Supported options include:

- `"None"`
- `"log10"`
- `"log2"`
- `"Standardization"`
- `"Z-Score"`
- `"scale"`
- `"center"`
- `"scale-center"`

**Step 3**: Click the **EXPORT DATA** button. This will generate a file named `Step4_data_transformed.rda` in your working directory for use in downstream analysis.
