## Overview

This module standardizes sample naming and reduces potential noise in the expression matrix for downstream analyses.

- **Step 1**: Load the results from the previous step.  
- **Step 2**: Enable **Rename Columns** to rename the expression matrix columns based on the sample information.  
- **Step 3**: Enable **Correct Noise**. For biological replicates, if a protein is **not detected in more than half** of the samples, it is considered potential noise and its intensities across **all** replicates will be set to **NA**.  
  Otherwise, missing values are imputed using the **mean of the available values** within the replicate group.

## Options

- **Rename Columns**  
  Renames expression matrix columns using the metadata in the sample information table to ensure consistent sample labels.

- **Correct Noise**  
  Applies replicate-aware filtering and imputation:
  - **Noise Rule**: If `#non-detected > 50%` of biological replicates for a protein, mark the **entire protein** as noise → set all intensities to `NA`.
  - **Imputation Rule**: If the protein does **not** meet the noise rule, impute remaining missing values with the **mean of observed values** (within the same biological replicate group).

## Output

After processing, a file named **`Step3_correct_noise.rda`** will be generated in your **working directory**.  
This file will be used as the input for the subsequent analysis steps.

## Notes

- “Not detected” typically refers to **missing intensity** (e.g., `NA` / absent after import).  
- Applying noise correction before differential analysis can improve robustness and interpretability.  
- Column renaming should precede noise correction to avoid ambiguity in replicate grouping.
