title: "Enrichment Analysis"
format: html
---

GO and KEGG enrichment analyses are essential downstream steps in proteomics, aiming to uncover the biological meaning behind differentially expressed proteins.  
GO analysis classifies proteins into **biological processes**, **molecular functions**, and **cellular components**,  
while KEGG identifies the **pathways** these proteins participate in, such as **metabolism**, **signaling**, or **disease-related pathways**.  
Together, they help interpret how protein-level changes translate into functional and mechanistic insights.

This module supports two types of workflows:

---

## ðŸ”¹ Method 1: Enrichment Based on ProtVis DEP Result

Use this method if you have generated the `Step7_DEP_result.rda` file using ProtVis.

**Step 1**: Set your **working directory** and click the **LOAD DATA** button.

**Step 2**: The system will automatically display a **Select DEP comparison** dropdown based on the comparison groups in your data.

**Step 3**: Upload the **background file** required for enrichment analysis.

**Step 4**: Select the appropriate **taxonomic group** (e.g., human, mouse, maize) for functional annotation.

**Step 5**: Check the desired analysis types: **GO**, **KEGG**, or both.

**Step 6**: Click the **ANALYSIS** button to start the enrichment analysis for the selected comparison group.

**Step 7**: In the result panel:
- Adjust **visualization parameters** (e.g., top terms, p-value threshold, label size).
- **Download** result **tables (CSV)** or **plots (PNG/PDF)** for downstream interpretation or publication.

## ðŸ”¹ Method 2: Enrichment Based on Custom Gene List

Use this method if you have a custom gene or protein list outside of the DEP results.

**Step 1**: Click the **Upload Gene List** button to load your list.

**Step 2**: Upload the corresponding **background file** that matches the gene ID type used in your list (e.g., UniProt, Entrez, Ensembl).

**Step 3**: Select the appropriate **taxonomic group**.

**Step 4**: Check the analysis type: **GO**, **KEGG**, or both.

**Step 5**: Click the **ANALYSIS** button to start enrichment analysis based on your uploaded list.

**Step 6**: Once complete, explore the enrichment results:
- Interactive plots and tables
- Parameter adjustment
- Result export (CSV, PNG, PDF)

> âœ… **Tip**: Ensure that the background file and gene/protein list use the same ID format and species. Inconsistent formats will result in failed or inaccurate enrichment results.
