**Expression Profile analysis** provides an overview of how protein expression levels vary across different samples or experimental conditions. By visualizing expression patterns—such as co-expression clusters or condition-specific expression trends—it helps identify biologically meaningful patterns, potential biomarkers, or proteins involved in shared regulatory mechanisms.

This module supports clustering-based visualization and customizable color schemes to explore dynamic expression profiles. The analysis workflow includes the following steps:

**Step 1**: Upload the **expression matrix** (e.g., normalized protein abundance table).

**Step 2**: **Choose a clustering method**, such as `"K-means"`.

**Step 3**: Select a **color scheme** via the **Select Color** option, and set the number of **centers** (i.e., clusters).

**Step 4**: Click the **RUN** button to perform clustering and generate the expression profile visualization.

**Step 5**: Adjust plotting parameters as needed (e.g., font size, label angle, cluster order), and **download the final plot** in your preferred format (e.g., PNG, PDF).
