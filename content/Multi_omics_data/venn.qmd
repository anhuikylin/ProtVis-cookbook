Venn diagrams are useful visual tools for comparing multiple datasets (e.g., proteomic, transcriptomic, or metabolomic lists) to identify shared and unique elements. This module allows intuitive visualization of overlaps among 2 to 6 sets, supporting downstream interpretation such as core gene discovery or cross-platform comparison.

## Biological Significance

Venn diagrams can highlight:
- **Common elements** shared across multiple conditions or datasets
- **Specific elements** unique to one group
- **Subset intersections** that may represent interesting biological signatures (e.g., co-regulated or condition-specific proteins)

This module is ideal for cross-omics integration and candidate filtering based on shared presence or exclusivity.

## Example Input

Upload a `.csv` file with column names representing sample groups (e.g., A, B, C, D, E), and each column containing corresponding gene or protein identifiers.

**Example (`veen.csv`)**:

| A        | B           | C           | D        | E         |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| pmf0256  | Lmgn000219  | Lmgn000219  | pmf0256  | mws4052   |
| mws0470  | pmf0256     | pmf0256     | pme2527  | MWSmce461 |
| mws0192  | pme3011     | pme3011     | MWS1848  | pme3033   |
| ...      | ...         | ...         | ...      | ...       |

## Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1**: **Upload the file**
- Click **Browse** and select your `veen.csv` file.

**Step 2**: **Customize Colors**
- Choose a **color** for each dataset (e.g., A–E) using hex codes or color pickers.
- Each set will be shown with distinct borders and transparent fill.

**Step 3**: **Run the Analysis**
- Click the **RUN** button.
- A Venn diagram will be automatically generated based on all intersections.

**Step 4**: **Download Results**
- Click the **Download** button to export the figure.
- Supported formats include PNG, PDF, SVG, etc.

## Visualization Panel

The central panel displays the resulting Venn diagram. Each number within the overlapping regions indicates the number of shared elements among those sets.

> ✅ **Tip**: You can adjust set names (A, B, C...) in your CSV file header to better reflect sample or condition names in your study.
