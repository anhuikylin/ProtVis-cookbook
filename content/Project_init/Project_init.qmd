## ️ Initialize Project

Follow the steps below to initialize a new ProtVis project:

1. **Set the global working directory**  
   This is where all intermediate and result files will be stored.

2. **Upload sample information**  
   The file should contain metadata such as sample names, groups, conditions, etc.

3. **Upload proteomics data**  
   This can be:
   - Raw files (e.g., `Raw`)
   - Or processed data exported from tools such as **MaxQuant**, **ProteomeDiscoverer**, **Skyline**, **Mascot**, or **OpenMS**.

4. **Select the data source**  
   Choose the appropriate format or software that matches your uploaded data.

5. **Click the `PROJECT INIT` button**  
   This will trigger the initialization process.
